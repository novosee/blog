 ## Why Vivid Sydney?
[Joe] Very simple, Super daddy wants to build a big vivid toy for his daughter. In all the kids’ eyes, Daddy is Superman, he can do anything he wants to do. My 6 years old daughter was one and only one tester in this project. She also contributed the idea “swipe light to brain”.
 
## Is it possible for a “geek” to become a “artist”?
[Joe] Yes, Art has been propelled by a new era revolutionized by technology, the Internet and a vast change in culture.  IoT is one of ST strategic focus, is anywhere now.  If we look back on the technical history of “public art”, there are 4 stages:
1. Static art installation, eg static statue
2. Dynamic art installation, eg multimedia art installation
3. Interactive art installation, eg with the help of sensor, visitor can interact with installation
4. Connected art installation, combined with internet and big data technology, installation can do 
                 more smart sensing and innovative interaction.
In my opinion, good art works combine art with new technologies. But traditional artists know little about technology. Geeks know little about art.
Partnered with local artists, we assembled a strong team with 4 members.
Joe (ST):  Hardware and Software design
Steve: Architecture and Mould design
Stephen: Video design
Jim: Field Install
Our target was to build a connected and interactive art light installation.
 
## What makes “Light of thoughts” unique in Vivid Sydney 2017?
[Joe] Powered by ST sensor and IoT technology, there are 4 unique features:
1.  It is one connected light installation which has all the data pushed to the cloud. Combined with 
 weather input, multiple of such installations can provide smart traffic prediction. Many  
 companies including the organizer and Deloitte showed great interest on it.
2.  The installation is also a built-in simulator; it can easily simulate and deploy light algorithm 
 online.
3.  Innovative interactive method. In fact, I tried several ST sensors which include motion sensor, 
 mems microphone, etc.  Ultimately, we went with gesture control, which is fresh and fun.
4.  Unique big brain consisting of 270 cubes which is not easy to make.
 
“Light of thoughts” not only caught the eyeballs of local media, it’s also reported by several foreign TV outside of Australia.

## Next Step?
[Joe] We may consider to setup a no-profit website “Geek learns ART”, aimed to educate and encourage  people to use STM32 open development environment to build their own art installation. Hopefully next year, more and more art installations will have ST inside.
