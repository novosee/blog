title: Vivid Story

In all the kids' eyes, Daddy is Superman, he can do anything he wants to do. I get 6 years old daught. My vivid story started from  Superdaddy acts as Artist, wants to build a big vivid toy for his daught.

But soon I realized that I'm not a Artist, and from some points of view, I'm a anti-Artist:  PhD in Digital Signal Procesing, around 20 years' technical background, I'm a typical greek instead of artist. 

After studying "Public Art", I quickly found maybe I can do something about it. From a technical perspective, Public Art experiences 4 stages.
1. Static art installation, eg static statue
2. Dynamic art installation, eg multimedia art installation  
3. Interactive art installation, eg with help of sensor, visitor can interact with installation. 
4. Connected art installation, combined with internect and big data technogly, installation can do more smart sensing and interaction.


Art has been propelled by a new era revolutionized by technology, the Internet and a vast change in culture. The vanguard has, as of late, been centered around often modernistic creations that encourage visitors to participate in mediums of art. A sense of inclusiveness and more engagement from the spectators make this movement highly beneficial, both to artists and those experiencing each artistic piece. 

Good works should combine art and new technologies. But traditional artists know little aboug technogy. Geeks know little aboug art. 

Partnered with local artists, we setup a strong team with 4 members.
- Joe(me) : hardware and software design
- Steve: mechanical and mould design
- Stephen: video design
- Jim: install and debug.

Our target is clear, we want to build connected and interactive light installation.
